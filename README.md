# Gamer Gate Hotel

HTML/CSS/JS Project that I am developing in my spare time to practice. This is modeled after a Fictional Hotel that caters to 
Avid Video Game Players. I will be starting with the basic HTML and text. I have sketches of what I want the website to look that 
I will be uploading soon. HTML has been on the backburner lately but eventually I would love to work with web development in more detail.

Any recommendations, ideas, or comments are more than welcome. 

Added the folders and linked the CSS/JavaScript from my Website templates. Began working on the file structure.

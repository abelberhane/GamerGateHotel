# Gamer Gate Hotel

HTML/CSS/JS Project that I am developing in my spare time to practice. This is modeled after a Fictional Hotel that caters to 
Avid Video Game Players. I will be starting with the basic HTML and text. I have sketches of what I want the website to look that 
I will be uploading soon. 

I have been adding to the site over time and like the progression. Soon I am going to link the in page links and address the spacing issue with the final image. This has been a great learning experience. 

Any recommendations, ideas, or comments are more than welcome. 

FlexSlider is the current outstanding item I would like to work on next.
